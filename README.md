# SocketProgramming
We Know the use of Sockets In java Which is an Object that accepts two arguments that is Port Number and Ip address. Although in this Project I have Mentioned The Port Number to be 9999 and Ip address same as your local host. what it does is connect you to the Server side and then it will accpet your request from the Client side and will Proceed with the Neccessary action.
